  <pre class="ac"> </pre>
  <pre class="ac">One fine day, he was searching a nice secondary school where</pre>
  <pre class="ac">he admits as a 9th class student. At the last of the day, he</pre>
  <pre class="ac">got a school named vincient simon frank school, which is 5</pre>
  <pre class="ac">miles away from his residence. He applies an admission</pre>

  <pre class="di">          We were in the study hall when the</pre>
  <pre class="di">          headmaster walked in, followed by a</pre>
  <pre class="di">          another new boy not wearing</pre>
  <pre class="di">          uniform, and by a janitor carrying</pre>
  <pre class="di">          a large desk. Those who were</pre>
  <pre class="di">          sleeping awoke, and we all stood up</pre>
  <pre class="di">          as though interrupting our work.</pre>
  <pre class="di">          The motioned to sit down, then</pre>
  <pre class="di">          turned to the teacher and said</pre>
  <pre class="di">          softly,"Lohali hardict, I'm placing</pre>
  <pre class="di">          this pupil in your care. He'll</pre>
  <pre class="di">          begin in eight grade, but if his</pre>
  <pre class="di">          work and conduct are good enough,</pre>
  <pre class="di">          he'll be promoted to where he ought</pre>
  <pre class="di">          to be at this age."</pre>
  <pre class="di">          the newcomer hung back in the</pre>
  <pre class="di">          corner behind the door, so that we</pre>
  <pre class="di">          could hardly see him. He was a</pre>
  <pre class="di">          country boy of about sixteen years,</pre>
  <pre class="di">          shorter than any one of us. He wore</pre>
  <pre class="di">          his hair cut straight across his</pre>
  <pre class="di">          forhead, like a contor in a village</pre>
